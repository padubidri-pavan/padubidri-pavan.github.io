Hi, I am Pavan Padubidri! ðŸ˜ƒ

I am a graduate student at New York University. I am currently located in New Jersey. My areas of interest are NLP, ML/DL and AI.

Since 2016 I have been woking on building mathematical models, interfacing with AI/ML models and build web applications. I had the opprtunity to work with LinkÃ¶ping University, Sweden, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and many industries designing and devloping modeling and simulation based products/solutions.

Currently I have been learning and working various ML concepts/projects. I worked at [Infrrd](https://www.infrrd.ai/) as Machine Learning Intern in their Research team, building NLP based solution using various transformer models.
